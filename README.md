# Credit_Risk_Modeling

## Project Summary

For this project, I will be exploring a dataset of debtors (borrowers) in order to try to compute three main components:

### 1) Probability of Default
This estimates the likelihood that a borrower will be unable to meet its debt obligations.

### 2) Loss Given Default
If a borrower defaults, LGD calculates the amount of money that is lost given by the creditor as a percentage of total exposure at the time of default.

### 3) Exposure at Default
This is the total value a bank is exposed to when a loan defaults.

These models were created in order to predict their respective purposes for given borrowers in the year of 2015. These values were saved and then used in order to calculuate the total Expectd Loss for the creditor.
